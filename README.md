# Plan My Trip (.NET Core)
> The "Plan my trip" example asks the user questions about an upcoming trip they'd like to take. As a part of this Alexa will gather information about when the trip will start as well as where they'd like to leave from and go to.

[![Build Status](https://haseebahmed7.visualstudio.com/PlanMyTripExample/_apis/build/status/haseebahmed7.dotnetcore-alexa-plan-my-trip)](https://haseebahmed7.visualstudio.com/PlanMyTripExample/_build/latest?definitionId=3)

This example was actually published by Amazon ([here](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/tree/master/feature-demos/skill-demo-dialog-delegate)) but has been ported to .NET Core by me.
